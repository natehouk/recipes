Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, approximately 1-2 minutes. Whisk in sugar, just a little at a time, until all the sugar is added. Once all sugar is added, whisk for about 1 minute longer.\
Add the cream, milk and mint extract and stir to blend. Careful not to whisk at this time, as that will create bubbles and the resulting ice cream will not be as rich or dense.\
Transfer mixture to ice cream maker. Follow according to your ice cream maker\'92s instructions.\
Add chopped pieces of chocolate during last five minutes of mixing. Freeze for at least 4-5 hours prior to serving. In my freezer, it usually takes up to 6 hours to get the way I like it.\
