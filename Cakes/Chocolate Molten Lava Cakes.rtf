1 cup granulated sugar\
1/4 cup cornstarch (sifted)\
1 teaspoon vanilla\
1/2 teaspoon salt\

    combined.\
4. Slowly pour the chocolate/butter mixture into the egg mixture, stir until\
    throughly combined.\

    overnight.\
6. Scoop mixture evenly into six cups.\
7. Bake for 15 minutes and turn to allow for even baking.\

    risen slightly above the sides of the pan and the center is puffed up \
    (but still soft to the touch).\
9. Let cool completely.  Then unmold by pushing the bottom disc upwards;\
    remove the disc from the bottom of each cake.\

 Place on a plate and garnish with chocolate curls and berries, or\
 whip cream and dust with cocoa.\
 To make raspberry flavor, just add 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam to the \
 chocolate/butter mixture and melt together.  Proceed with the rest of the\
 recipe.\
