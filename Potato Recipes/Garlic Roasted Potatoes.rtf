\cf0 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\
Cut the potatoes in half or quarters and place in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic; toss until the potatoes are well coated. Transfer the potatoes to a sheet pan and spread out into 1 layer. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until browned and crisp. Flip twice with a spatula during cooking in order to ensure even browning.\
Remove the potatoes from the oven, toss with parsley, season to taste, and serve hot.\
