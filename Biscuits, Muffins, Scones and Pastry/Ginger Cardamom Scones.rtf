\b0\fs48 \
\

\b Ingredients
\b0 \
2 1/4 cups flour\
1/3 cup sugar\
1 T. baking powder\
1 t. ground cardamom\
4 1/2 ounces crystalized ginger, finely chopped\
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, frozen\
3/4  cup heavy cream, plus extra for brushing\
\

\b Directions\

\b0 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.\
In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cardamom and ginger.  Pulse to combine.  And add cold butter and pulse to combine until mixture resembles fine meal.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and make a well in the center.  Add the cream and stir with a fork until just combined.  Gently knead into a ball and roll or pat the dough into a circle on a lightly floured surface about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut out the scones using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, gathering scraps and pressing the pieces back together until all the dough is used.\
Brush the tops with remaining cream and bake 14-18 minutes until the tops are lightly brown.\
