\f0\b\fs52 \cf2 Traditional Cannoli Shells\

\fs46 (Makes about 18)\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\ql\qnatural

\b0\fs42 \cf0 3 cups flour\
1/4 cup sugar\
1 teaspoon cinnamon\
1/4 teaspoon salt\
3 tablespoons shortening\
2 eggs, well beaten\
2 tablespoons white vinegar\
2 tablespoons cold water\
1 egg white, slightly beaten\
Vegetable oil for deep frying\
\
\
Sift together flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt.\
Cut shortening in with a pastry blender until the pieces are the size of small peas.\
Stir in eggs. \'a0Blend in the vinegar and cold water.\
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.\
Add additional flour, if needed, to get a smooth dough.\
Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.\
\
Set out 6 aluminum cannoli tubes.\
Heat oil in a deep saucepan \'a0to 360 degrees F.\
Cut an oval shaped pattern from cardboard about 6x4-inches.\
\
Roll chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness.\
Place the cardboard pattern on dough and cut out as many as will fit on the dough.\
Wrap dough loosely around tubes slightly overlapping opposite ends.\
Seal ends by brushing with egg white and pressing together.\
Fry only as many shells as will float uncrowded in the hot oil.\
Fry until light golden brown, 3-4 minutes.\
Remove cannoli shells to paper towels to drain.\
Cool slightly and remove the tubes. \'a0Cool shells completely.\
Continue forming and frying cannoli shells.\
\
Using a pastry bag or a small spoon, fill the shells with the filling from both ends.\
Do not fill the shells until up to an hour before serving, as the filling will make the shells soggy.\
Sprinkle ends with reserved chopped pistachio nuts and dust with confectioners sugar.\

\b\fs46 \cf2 Baked Cannoli Shells\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\ql\qnatural

\i\b0\fs42 \cf0 These elegant pastry tubes of caramelized, baked puff pastry are a bit less rich than the traditional.\
They are more appropriately filled with pastry cream, but you can use the ricotta filling as well.\
You will need 12 metal tubes for baking these.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\ql\qnatural

\i0 \cf0 One sheet of Puff Pastry dough \'a0(
\i you can find this in the frozen food section of your market
\i0 )\
1/3 cup sugar\
Butter 12 metal cannoli tubes.\
\
Spread the dough on a slightly floured surface and roll it to measure 12 x 12-inches.\
Use a pastry wheel to cut it into 12 strips, each 1 x 12-inches.\
Lightly brush the surface of the dough with water.\
Pick up one of the dough strips and turn it so that the dry side is facing up.\
Place the end of a tube at the left side of the strip and roll the tube so that the dough rolls up on it in a spiral fashion.\
Do not roll too tightly or stretch the dough or the baked pastry will be impossible to remove from the tube.\
The dough will not cover the entire length of the tube.\
Also be sure that the beginning and end of the strip are on the same side of the tube.\
Having the seam underneath during baking will prevent them from unraveling.\
\
Place the dough wrapped tubes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\
Sprinkle them with the sugar.\
Bake at 350 degrees F for about 30 minutes, until the pastry is dry and well caramelized.\
Remove the pastry shells from the tubes immediately.\
Grip the pastry in one hand, protected with a clean towel or paper towel and pull out the tube with tongs.\
Cool the cannoli shells on a rack before filling. \'a0Store the shells in an airtight container at room temperature.\
Fill the cannoli no more than an hour before serving or the pastry will become soggy.\
