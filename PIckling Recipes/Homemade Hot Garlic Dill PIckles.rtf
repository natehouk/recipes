\b\fs48 \cf0 Ingredients
\b0\fs40 \
Pickling salt\
Jalapeno peppers\
Fresh grape leaves\
Fresh cucumbers\
Whole peppercorn\
5% distilled white vinegar\
Whole, peeled, garlic cloves\
Fresh dill sprigs\
Crushed red peppers, optional for extra hot \
\
Please note that you'll want to pick out cucumbers that are three to five inches long. Any variety of cucumber will do really, not only pickling cucumbers. I personally use whole cucumbers and have never tried slicing them.\

\b0\fs40 \
1. Be sure to prepare your jars in boiling water, leave them in for at least 15 minutes at a boil.\
2. In a very large pot mix together 2 quarts water, 2 cups white vinegar, and 1 1/2 cups of \
     salt.\
     Boil this solution until all of the salt has dissolved.\
3. In each of your now sterilized jars placed the following: one sprig of dill weed, one   \
     Jalapeno pepper (be sure to slice it lengthwise),   \
     three cloves of garlic, one half teaspoon of black peppercorn, and two grape leaves.\
4. Wash your cucumbers and cold water. Now fill, nearly to the top, the jars with your   \
     cucumbers. Pour your hot vinegar mix in the  \
     jar until it is nearly full.\
5. Seal each jar and conduct a hot water bath with them for 15 minutes.}
