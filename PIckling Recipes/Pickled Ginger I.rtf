Wash and peel the fresh ginger and slice it thinly using a vegetable peeler or mandolin. You want the slices to be paper-thin. Alternatively, you could slice the ginger into\'a0thin strips.\
Cover the ginger with boiling water and dissolve 1 tbsp of salt. Let the mixture sit for 3-5\'a0minutes; this will soften and slightly cook the ginger, making it last longer and absorb the brine better. Be careful not to make it too soft though \'96 the ginger should still be crunchy when you strain the hot brine.\
Retain the hot brine and place the sliced ginger in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle over 1 tsp of salt. Squeeze the ginger with your hand so the salt is absorbed.\
Add the vinegar to the ginger and rub well. Balance the flavours by adding sugar to taste.\
Put the ginger into jars and submerge it in the reserved brine. Leave in the fridge overnight. The pickle can be kept for several weeks in\'a0the\'a0fridge.}
