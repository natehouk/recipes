lime zest\

\
Notes:.\
This is a recipe that really flexes to personal taste.\
Add a little zest unless you like a lot - then add more.\
Start with juice from half the lime , one garlic and one chipotle, ziz it up, then add what you like more of - I like 1 chipotle, 2 garlic and juice from the whole lime and zest from half a lime, but lime sizes vary greatly and so does how much juice you get. You want a tangy, garlicky crema with some pow from the chipotle.\
