\f1\fs46 \cf3 The first thing you need to do is grab a bunch of heads of garlic. Try not to buy them too small. Then, cut off just enough of the top to expose all of the cloves inside.\
Drizzle a little olive oil (1 or 2 tablespoons) in a pie pan.\
Then, just tilt the pan around to coat the bottom thoroughly.\
Next, place the garlic heads, cut side up, in the pan. If the heads won\'92t sit flat on the pan, just give the bottom a little slice to even it out.\
Drizzle the exposed cloves with olive oil. You want them to have a coating of moisture so they won\'92t burn easily.\
Then, sprinkle the cloves with kosher salt. \
(The reason Kosher salt is called Kosher salt, is 
\i \cf3 not
\i0 \cf3  because the salt, in itself, is kosher. It\'92s that it\'92s used by butchers to make 
\i \cf3 meats
\i0 \cf3  kosher (its flat, flaky quality adheres more readily to the surface of foods)\
After you salt the cloves, you\'92ll want to pepper them, too.\
Cover the pan with aluminum foil.\
Place in a 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes.\
After the heads have cooled, all you have to do to extract the roasted cloves is to grab the bottom of the head and gently squeeze until the cloves pop out. They should be quite mushy.\
