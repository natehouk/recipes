\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\sa140\ql\qnatural

\f1\b0\fs42 \cf0 Combine the lemon juice, \cf2 zest\cf0 , mustard, rosemary and crushed red pepper in a small bowl. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the mustard mixture to loosen it. Paint this mixture generously all over the chicken and let sit for up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. \
Preheat the grill to medium; we want the chicken to cook on the grill as long as possible without burning to develop lovely crispy, tasty skin. Clean grill with a wire grill brush and run an oiled towel over the grill. Season the chicken lightly with salt and arrange gently on the grill, we are looking for lovely crosshatch grill marks. Put the lemon halves, cut side down, on the grill also and do not disturb until they look brown and caramelized. They will smell great while they are cooking too!\
Once the chicken has started to get brown and crispy and has developed grill marks in 1 direction, rotate the chicken a quarter turn in the other direction. The chicken should cook on the \cf2 skin\cf0  side for 10 to 12 minutes and then get turned over and cooked for the same amount of time.\
Cooks Note: During the cooking time it is a great idea to close the grill to allow the heat to cook from all directions. If grilling indoors, the chicken can be transferred to a preheated 375 degree F oven to \cf2 finish\cf0  cooking once the grill marks have been established.\
The chicken is done when the juices run clear when the pricked in the thickest part of the thigh. Remove the chicken from the grill to a serving platter and serve with the grilled \cf2 lemon\cf0  halves. Squeeze the grilled lemon over the chicken.\
