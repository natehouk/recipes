\b To Poach the Chicken
\b0 : Rinse the chicken and pat dry. Remove the giblets (and reserve for other uses) and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.expertvillage.com/video/16486_chicken-truss.htm"}}{\fldrslt \ul truss}} (see picture above). Place the chicken, celery, onion, carrots, garlic, herbs and white wine in a large stockpot. Add enough cold water or stock to cover the chicken by several inches. Add the salt, peppercorns and chile.\
Place stockpot over medium-high heat and slowly bring to a simmer. Cook gently for 30 to 45 minutes Make sure the liquid DOES NOT BOIL. Cover the pot and remove from the heat. Allow to stand for an additional 30 minutes or up to 1 hour for the chicken to finish cooking. Do not lift the lid during this time or cooking heat will be dissipated. The chicken won\'92t overcook, even if left for the maximum time. To check for doneness, pierce the thickest part of the thigh and make sure the juices run clear.\
