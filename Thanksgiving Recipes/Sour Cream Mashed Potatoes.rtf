\cf0 Put the potatoes in a saucepan; cover with cold water and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-low to medium heat and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let sit until just cool enough to handle, then peel and transfer to a bowl.\
Add the butter to the potatoes. Add the sour cream, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and pepper to taste; mash with a potato masher or fork.\
Halve the garlic heads crosswise, put them on a sheet of foil and drizzle with olive oil; wrap and roast at 350 degrees F, 1 hour. Squeeze out the cloves; mash and stir into the potatoes. Fold in the mustard. Spoon the mashed potatoes into a serving dish and sprinkle with the bacon.\
