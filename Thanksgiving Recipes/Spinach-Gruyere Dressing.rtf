\b \

\b0 Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks, mushrooms, celery, sage and thyme; add salt and pepper to taste, and cook 5 minutes. Add chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Let the broth mixture cool slightly. Beat eggs with parsley in a large bowl; add bread, chopped spinach and gruy\'e8re cheese then pour in the vegetable-broth mixture and toss. Transfer to a buttered baking dish and dot with butter. Cover and bake 30 minutes at 375 degrees F; uncover and bake until golden, 30 more minutes.
