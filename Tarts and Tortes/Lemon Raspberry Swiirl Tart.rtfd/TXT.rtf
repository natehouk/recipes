\b0\fs54 \cf2 sweet tart crust
\b\fs32 \cf0                      
\b0 \uc0\u8232 ingredients\u8232 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\u8232 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar\u8232 1/4 teaspoon salt\u8232 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon (9 tablespoons; 4 1/2 ounces) very cold (or frozen) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\u8232 1 large egg yolk\
put the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. scatter the pieces of butter over the dry ingredients and pulse until the butter is coarsely cut in - you should have pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and some the size of peas. stir the yolk, just to break it up, and add it a little at a time, pulsing after each addition. when the egg is in, process in long pulses - about 10 seconds each - until the dough, which will look granular soon after the egg is added, forms clumps and curds. just before you reach this stage, the sound of the machine working the dough will change. turn the dough out onto a work surface and, very lightly and sparingly, knead the dough just to incorporate any dry ingredients that might have escaped mixing.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 to roll or press the dough into the pan: butter a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.\
if you want to roll the dough, chill it for about 2 hours before rolling \uc0\u8232 \u8232 if you want to use the press-in method, you can work with the dough as soon as it's processed. just press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. don't press too hard-\'a0just enough so the\'a0edges of the pieces cling to one another, but don't press so hard that the crust loses its crumbly texture.\u8232 \u8232 freeze the crust for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.\
to fully bake the crust: center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375 F\
butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil (or use nonstick foil) and fit the foil, buttered side down, tightly against the crust.\'a0no pie weights needed.\'a0put the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake the crust for 20 minutes. carefully remove the foil. if the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. bake the crust for another 8 minutes or so, or until it is firm and golden brown.\'a0\'a0transfer the pan to a rack and cool the crust to room temperature.\
the dough can be wrapped and kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 2 months. while the fully baked crust can be packed airtight and frozen for up to 2 months.\

i usually send the curd through a sieve to make sure to have a smooth consistency - but this isn't necessary. \
