\fs48 Butter or baking spray\uc0\u8232 8 cups cubed day-old bread (I used firm white bread, crust removed)\u8232 1/4 cup butter, melted (1/2 stick)\u8232 2 tsp chocolate chips\u8232 4 eggs\u8232 1-1/2 cups skim milk\u8232 1/2 cup heavy cream\u8232 1/4 cup sugar\u8232 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\u8232 1/2 cup Nutella\u8232 1/4 tsp kosher salt\
Grease (with butter or baking spray) the canister of a 3-quart slow cooker. Place the bread cubes in the canister.\
In a small glass measuring cup, melt the butter and chocolate chips in a microwave (30-45 seconds on high). Set aside to cool slightly while you add all of the remaining ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and chocolate mixture to the bowl, and whisk vigorously to combine until the custard is as smooth as possible.\
Pour the custard over the bread cubes, and gently press on the bread (do not stir) until the top cubes have absorbed the custard.\
Cook on LOW for 3 hours. Serve warm, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or heavy cream.}
