Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\
1. Combine the gingersnaps, oil, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to form fine crumbs. Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake until the crust is set and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.\
2. In a large bowl, stir together the pumpkin puree, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar until blended; stir in the frozen yogurt. Spread into the cooled pie crust and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. Wrap tightly in plastic to freeze up to 1 week.\
3. When ready to serve, transfer the pie to the refrigerator to soften slightly, about 30 minutes.\
